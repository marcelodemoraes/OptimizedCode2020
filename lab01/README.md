# Matrix Multiplication Optmization

In this lab we used two diferent techniques to make a senquential matrix multiplication more efficient: **loop interchange** and **loop unrolling**.

## Loop Interchange

Change looping order toward achiving more cache hits.

## Loop Unrolling

Incrise de amount of multiplied elements in order to avoid branch misses.
